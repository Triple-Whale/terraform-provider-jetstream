<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the stream

### Optional

- `ack` (Boolean) If the Stream should support confirming receiving messages via acknowledgements
- `allow_direct` (Boolean) Allow higher performance, direct access to get individual messages via the $JS.DS.GET API
- `allow_rollup_hdrs` (Boolean) Allows the use of the Nats-Rollup header to replace all contents of a stream, or subject in a stream, with a single new message
- `compression` (String) Optional compression algorithm used for the Stream
- `deny_delete` (Boolean) Restricts the ability to delete messages from a stream via the API. Cannot be changed once set to true
- `deny_purge` (Boolean) Restricts the ability to purge messages from a stream via the API. Cannot be change once set to true
- `description` (String) Contains additional information about this stream
- `discard` (String) When a Stream reach it's limits either old messages are deleted or new ones are denied
- `discard_new_per_subject` (Boolean) When discard policy is new and the stream is one with max messages per subject set, this will apply the new behavior to every subject. Essentially turning discard new from maximum number of subjects into maximum number of messages in a subject
- `duplicate_window` (Number) The size of the duplicate tracking windows, duration specified in seconds
- `max_age` (Number) The maximum oldest message that can be kept in the stream, duration specified in seconds
- `max_bytes` (Number) The maximum size of all messages that can be kept in the stream
- `max_consumers` (Number) Number of consumers this stream allows
- `max_msg_size` (Number) The maximum individual message size that the stream will accept
- `max_msgs` (Number) The maximum amount of messages that can be kept in the stream
- `max_msgs_per_subject` (Number) The maximum amount of messages that can be kept in the stream on a per-subject basis
- `metadata` (Map of String) Free form metadata about the stream
- `mirror` (Block List, Max: 1) Specifies a remote stream to mirror into this one (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mirror))
- `placement_cluster` (String) Place the stream in a specific cluster, influenced by placement_tags
- `placement_tags` (List of String) Place the stream only on servers with these tags
- `replicas` (Number) How many replicas of the data to keep in a clustered environment
- `republish_destination` (String) The destination to publish messages to
- `republish_headers_only` (Boolean) Republish only message headers, no bodies
- `republish_source` (String) Republish messages to republish_destination
- `retention` (String) The retention policy to apply over and above max_msgs, max_bytes and max_age
- `source` (Block List) Specifies a list of streams to source into this one (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--source))
- `storage` (String) The storage engine to use to back the stream
- `subject_transform` (Block List, Max: 1) Subject transform to apply to matching messages (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subject_transform))
- `subjects` (List of String) The list of subjects that will be consumed by the Stream, may be empty when sources and mirrors are present

- `start_time` (String) The time stamp in the source stream to start from, in RFC3339 format
